### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kevin and I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on something in the news/journalism/publishing field, I just don't know what it is yet.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python (again, i have no idea what I'm doing)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything about my 10+-year-old tech blog, KnowTechie.com
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: kevin@knowtechie.com
- ðŸ˜„ Fun fact: I'm a professional metal drummer with over 30+ years of experience

Let me just close this out with an obvious fact: I still have no idea what i'm doing. I truly don't know how I made it this far.
